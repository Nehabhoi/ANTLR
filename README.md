 <h3 align="center">ANTLR : Another Tool for Language Recognition</h3>

 </p>

 ### Description
This project was build to demonstrate my  proficiency and ability to use ANTLR, as well as my understanding of language grammar rules. I hope this projects demonstrate my understanding of how programming language grammar works.  The list of projects is listed below:</br>
 1. Setup
 2. Print Statement Grammer
 3. Expression Evaluation Grammer
 4. let Statement Grammer
 5. Integer Input Statement Grammer

 ### What is ANTLR?
 1. A compiler compiler
 2. Free, command line, its own IDE (ANTLRWorks) or IDE embedded in Netbeans, Eclipse, whatever
 3. Supports multiple output languages but defaults to Java
 4. Other languages require separate libraries 
 5. Grammar structure is mostly EBNF but some little differences
